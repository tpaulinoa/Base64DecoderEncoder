## Base64DecoderEncoder 

A simple portable Base64 decoder and encoder. I need to make some encoding/decoding with many files at once, so I built this tool.
These is the features implemented in the first version:

- Encode/Decode 
  - simple text
  - files (a single file or a whole folder)
  - an encoded text to image preview
