## Base64DecoderEncoder 

A simple portable Base64 decoder and encoder. I needed to make some encoding/decoding with many files at once, so I built this tool.
These is the features implemented in the first version:

- Encode/Decode 
  - simple text
  - files (a single file or a whole folder)
  - an encoded text to image preview

#### Build


To build project, you should have Gradle installed.
After, just run command "gradle buildJar" in the folder's project.


##### **Important! This tool requires JRE 1.8**
